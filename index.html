          <h2>A beautiful interface in less than 30 seconds</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>
              If you want to quickly set up a nice little interface on your website,
              a Majordome is what you need
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Majordome is a little CSS boilerplate without any CSS class, just basic
            declarations on all the tags you'll use in your website. The goal is to
            change the default look of your virgin HTML page to add some style to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The important point is that it only does a basic interface</strong>, and you'll need
            to write CSS yourself or use a framework such as Bootstrap or
            <a href="http://rominou34.github.io/papillon/">Papillon</a> if you want to
            create a more complex interface.

          <h2>No CSS needed</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Don't waste time writing CSS, the Majordome is here to do this for you
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Just write your website's structure using HTML, link the Majordome
            stylesheet, and watch the magic unfold

          <h2>How can I use it ?</h2>
          <p>
            First of all, Majordome isn't a full CSS framework like Bootstrap or
            <a href="http://rominou34.github.io/papillon/">Papillon</a>, <strong>don't use it
            if you plan to create a complex interface</strong>, as it will only slow you down.
          </p>
          <h3>Then when should I use it ?</h3>
          <p>
            Majordome is a boilerplate meant for side projects or quick mockups of
            website, when you don't have the time to fully create a nice interface.<br/>
            <strong>For example,</strong> let's say you start a new PHP project and you start developping
            a little admin interface. Without any CSS, it's ugly as hell so you have
            to write a little bit to at least have something presentable. But then
            you have to make it responsive, it bugs, etc...<br/><br/>
            <strong>Enough of this hassle,</strong> just import the Majordome stylesheet
            and there you have it, your little UI
          </p>

            This whole page was created using Majordome, without any other CSS
            written, so it can serve as an example, but further examples of every
            HTML objects will be shown below.
